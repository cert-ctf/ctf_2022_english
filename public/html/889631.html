					<p class="text-justify">Breaking new ground in exchange with the expert community:<br><br>This is what gematik's 1st TI Capture The Flag (CTF) event stands for. On the occasion of the launch of the e-prescription - a milestone in digital healthcare in Germany - gematik invited IT and IT security enthusiasts as well as cyber security professionals to solve IT security tasks in the context of the e-prescription in a virtual world. 139 participants accepted the invitation.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">"What a successful start! A total of 50 teams really gave their best to find the hidden flags in the shortest possible time. We are impressed by the positive response to the event and the dedication the teams showed," Holm Diening, Chief Security Officer at gematik, sums up. "The event was not only a lot of fun, but also showed that there is a great deal of interest in our applications from the specialist community. This encourages us in our plan to offer such an event on a regular basis."</p>
					<p class="text-justify">The event was also a complete success for IBM Germany and RISE Germany, gematik's partners for the e-prescription:
			"We are working closely and in a spirit of trust with gematik on the e-prescription project. One focus here is to put the e-prescription application landscape through its "paces". The Capture The Flag competition has shown the core of our work by simulating vulnerable applications that are based on the e-prescription," says Ronald Fritz, Senior Partner IBM Consulting.

					<p class="text-justify"><br>"The introduction of the e-recipe is currently one of the largest IT projects in Europe. Organizing the CTF event in this exciting context with project partners and customers, thus entering into direct exchange with the very active community, is not only extremely valuable for "hardening" the system, such an approach will probably be a role model and standard for large projects for a digitally self-determined Europe in the future," emphasizes Christian Schanes, Board Member for IT Security at Research Industrial Systems Engineering (RISE) Forschungs-, Entwicklungs- und Gro√üprojektberatung GmbH.</p>
